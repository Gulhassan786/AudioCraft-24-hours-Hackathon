<h2>AudioCraft-24-hours-Hackathon</h2> 
Its 24 hours hackathon hosted by <a href="https://lablab.ai/event">lablab.ai</a> in which dive into the cutting-edge of audio processing and generation with deep learning! Empower our audio applications with AudioCraft for richer, more versatile soundscapes
<h3>What is AudioCraft </h3> 
AudioCraft is a generative AI tool for audio and music developed by Meta AI. It is a single-stop code base for all your generative audio needs: music, sound effects, and compression after training on raw audio signals.
## AudioCraft consists of three models:

<ul>
  <li> <b> MusicGen: </b> This model generates music from text descriptions. You can provide a melody, chords, or even just a few words, and MusicGen will create a full-fledged song.</li>
   <li><b>AudioGen:</b> This model generates sound effects from text descriptions. You can specify the type of sound effect you want, such as a door creaking or a gunshot, and AudioGen will create a realistic audio clip.</li>
   <li><b> EnCodec: </b>This model encodes and decodes audio signals. This is used by MusicGen and AudioGen to convert text descriptions into audio signals and vice versa.</li>
</ul>
